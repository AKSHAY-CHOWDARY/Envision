    Several improvements can be made to enhance this resume information.  The key is to be concise, impactful, and to showcase achievements, not just activities.  Since we lack specifics about Chenna's education, projects, etc., I'll provide example enhancements assuming certain details.  **You MUST replace the bracketed information with Chenna's actual details.**


**Option 1:  A more concise resume summary style**

**Name:** Chenna Sanjana
**Headline:**  Highly motivated and results-oriented Computer Science Engineering student at VNR VIGNANA JYOTHI INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, pursuing innovative solutions.
**Location:** Hyderabad, Telangana, India

**Option 2:  A more traditional resume format (if space allows)**

This option would expand each section, providing more details under each heading.  It would be suitable for a longer resume.


Remember to replace the bracketed information with Chenna's actual details.  Tailor the resume to each specific job application, highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences.  Use action verbs to start your descriptions (e.g., developed, designed, implemented, managed).  Quantify your accomplishments whenever possible to demonstrate the impact of your work.
